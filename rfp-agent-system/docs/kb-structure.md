## 3. Solutioning
### 3.1 Architecture
#### Architecture Requirements
- It should also identify if its a Read Heavy or Write Heavy System?
- Workload Type - What type of system is it? (Transactional system / Workflow engine / AI-driven insights / Reporting system / Event-driven system / Microservices or monolith)
#### Technology Stack Preferences (Should come from long term memory)
#### Integration Requirements
	- Integration Model	- How will it talk to other systems? (API-based, Event-based, Batch processing, Hybrid)
#### Data Architecture and Database Requirements
	- Data Model - From the RFP, identify: data sources, data volume, data retention, data sensitivity		
#### Security Requirements
	- Security & Identity Requirements - SSO, MFA, RBAC, Zero trust, API protection needed
#### Infrastructure Requirements (Cloud, On-Premise, Hybrid)
#### Deployment Architecture
	- Deployment - Cloud (Azure/AWS/GCP), Hybrid, On-prem, Containerization vs App Service
#### Scalability and High-Availability Architecture
#### Environments
	- What stages does the code go through before production? if each of these stage requires a separate data setup - no of envs needed for testing)		
#### Logical Architecture
	- Identitfy Modules, Services, Data flow, Integrations, Security zones
	- To be converted to diagrams later
#### Technical Architecture
	- Identitfy Technology stack, Frameworks, Deployment model, CI/CD pipelines, Observability stack
	- To be converted to diagrams later
