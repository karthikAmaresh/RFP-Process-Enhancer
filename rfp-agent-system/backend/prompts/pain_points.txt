## 2.2 User Pain Points

For each pain point identified:

### [Pain Point Category] (e.g., Performance, Usability, Integration)
**Problem:** What is the specific pain point?
**Impact:** How does this affect users/business?
  - Quantify if possible (time lost, cost, errors, etc.)
**Affected Users:** Who experiences this pain point?
**Frequency:** How often does this occur?
**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
**Current Workaround:** How do users deal with this today?
**Desired Outcome:** What would solve this pain point?

Categories to analyze:
- System Performance (slow, crashes, timeouts)
- User Experience (confusing, complex, time-consuming)
- Integration Issues (data silos, manual transfers)
- Data Quality (errors, inconsistencies, missing data)
- Security/Compliance (vulnerabilities, audit issues)
- Scalability (can't handle growth)
- Cost (too expensive to maintain/operate)

Format: Organize by category, prioritize by severity.
