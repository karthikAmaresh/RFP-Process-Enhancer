REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) Automated Troubleshooting of Vehicle Issues Using Agentic AI By ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. 1. Company Overview ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is a leader in digital transformation, specializing in intelligent automation, enterprise software solutions, and AI-driven innovation for automotive and manufacturing sectors. Our mission is to simplify complex workflows through smart, scalable solutions that enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and accelerate decision-making. 2. Project Requirements 2.1 Project Background Vehicle troubleshooting today relies heavily on manual reference to repair manuals, diagnostic PDFs, OEM knowledge bases, and historical service records. This process is slow, inconsistent, and highly dependent on technician expertise. We aim to build an Agentic Al-based troubleshooting assistant that can interpret manuals, understand symptoms, and guide technicians toward accurate step-by-step diagnosis. 2.2 Business Goal To automate and accelerate vehicle issue diagnosis by using AI agents that can read, interpret, and reason over technical manuals, fault codes, and historical data. 2.3 Problem to Solve Technicians currently: . Spend excessive time searching manuals · Depend on tribal knowledge . Lack consistent diagnostic guidance · Face challenges when manuals are fragmented across multiple documents The goal is to build an AI system that: . Reads and understands all manuals · Maps symptoms > probable root causes · Provides guided troubleshooting steps · Reduces service time and improves accuracy 2.4 Current State · Manuals exist across multiple PDF formats . No centralized search or indexing . No automated troubleshooting workflow · Troubleshooting steps vary between technicians 2.5 Project Scope Vendors must help design and build an agent-based AI troubleshooting solution: Required Capabilities · Document ingestion (PDF, images, manuals) · Text extraction and chunking · Embedding + vector search · Multi-agent system for: o Symptom understanding o Troubleshooting step generation o Root cause identification o Recommendation explanation · UI for technicians · API layer for integrations · Observability & monitoring 2.6 Technology Expectations You may propose your preferred stack, but we currently use: · Azure Cloud (OpenAI, Blob, Functions) · Python for Al components · React for UI · Vector DB (Azure Search, MongoDB Atlas, or local LLM options) 2.7 What We Expect to Be Built · End-to-end design · Al ingestion pipeline (PDF > text > embeddings > vector store) · Agentic workflow for troubleshooting · Suggestion ranking & confidence scoring · UI design (technician dashboard + chat + recommendations) · Testing (unit, integration) · Deployment architecture (cloud or hybrid) 2.8 Management & Communication Requirements · Weekly sprint updates · Agile methodology · Collaboration via Teams/Jira . Documented APIs + architecture · NDA required 2.9 Roles Needed Vendors should include: · AI/ML Engineer · Agent Workflow Engineer · Backend Developer (Python/Node/.NET) · UI Engineer (React) · QA Engineer · DevOps/Cloud Engineer 3. Project Budget and Timeline 3.1 Budget Proposals may include tiered pricing. We expect: · Cost breakdown by module · Licensing/hosting costs · Support & maintenance cost 3.2 Timeline Target duration: 10-16 weeks Key milestones should include: · Requirement analysis · Architecture & design · Prototype · Full implementation ·
