### Business Process Mapping for AI Chatbot Implementation

#### **Current Business Processes and Workflow**
1. **Customer Query Handling (Current State)**:
   - **Trigger**: Customers reach out to support through email or phone calls.
   - **Steps**:  
     1. Customer sends an email or places a call with their query.  
     2. Support team manually triages the query to determine its type and urgency.  
     3. Support agents search for relevant information across scattered documents/knowledge sources.  
     4. The agent responds to the customer.
   - **Challenges Identified**:  
     - High volume of repeated queries.  
     - Delayed response due to manual handling.  
     - No unified knowledge base.  
     - No automation or self-service capabilities.

---

#### **Proposed Business Workflow with AI Chatbot**
1. **Customer Interaction Flow**:
   - **Trigger**: Customer initiates a query via a chatbot interface (web/mobile).  
   - **Steps**:  
     1. Customer interacts with the chatbot using natural language input.  
     2. The chatbot processes the input using intent classification and natural language understanding (NLU).  
     3. The chatbot checks the knowledge base or FAQ database for relevant answers using document-based question answering.
     4. If the query matches a pre-defined intent or FAQ, the chatbot generates a response and sends it to the user.  
     5. If the query cannot be resolved, the chatbot escalates or routes the query to the appropriate human agent in the CRM/ticketing system (manual triaging is replaced by automated routing).  

   - **Integration Points**:  
     - Integration with Azure OpenAI for GPT-40-based question-answering.  
     - Integration with Azure Search for document retrieval.  
     - Integration with CRM/ticketing system to log tickets for unresolved queries.  
     - Integration with Azure SQL or Cosmos DB for knowledge base storage.

---

2. **Knowledge Base Management Flow**:
   - **Steps**:  
     1. Existing knowledge scattered across documents is consolidated into a unified knowledge base.  
     2. Knowledge is indexed into Azure SQL/Cosmos DB for structured query access.  
     3. Updates to knowledge base content are synchronized through a supervisor dashboard.  
     4. FAQ updates and new intents are trained into the chatbot using model fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

---

3. **Query Escalation and Routing Flow**:
   - **Steps**:  
     1. If a query cannot be resolved at the first level, the chatbot classifies and routes it to the appropriate agent group in the CRM/ticketing system.  
     2. The agent receives the ticket with context pre-filled by the chatbot (e.g., chat history, user details, initial query intent).  
     3. Supervisor dashboards provide insights into escalation patterns and unresolved queries for optimization.

---

4. **Analytics and Optimization Workflow**:
   - **Steps**:  
     1. Chatbot logs interactions, query types, and fallback events in an analytics dashboard.  
     2. Supervisors monitor analytics to identify high-fallback queries or gaps in the knowledge base.  
     3. Insights from analytics are used to refine the chatbot model, improve intents, and update the knowledge base.  
     4. Regular performance reviews ensure that the chatbot meets the 40-60% support load reduction goal.
