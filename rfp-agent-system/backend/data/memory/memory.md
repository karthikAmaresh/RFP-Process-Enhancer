### Architecture Insights
**Recorded:** 2025-12-11 14:57:56
The system's architecture should enable end-to-end e-commerce functionality compatible with B2C and B2B transactions, emphasize secure integration with multiple payment gateways, and leverage cloud-based solutions (Azure/AWS/GCP). Frontend frameworks like React.js/Angular/Vue.js, backend technologies like Node.js/.NET Core/Python, and databases like PostgreSQL/MySQL or MongoDB are preferred. Scalability, CI/CD, and high availability are essential.
