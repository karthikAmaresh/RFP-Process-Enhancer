## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement  
ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. is currently facing significant operational challenges in its inventory management processes. The existing workflow relies heavily on manual tracking methods, such as spreadsheets and manual stock counts, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time visibility. This inefficiency results in operational delays, stock inconsistencies, and an inability to generate predictive insights, ultimately impacting business productivity and decision-making.  

The absence of automated systems also hinders the organization's ability to promptly address inventory-related anomalies, such as low stock levels or expired items, and prevents proactive replenishment. As the business scales and inventory complexities grow, these challenges are becoming increasingly detrimental. To address these pressing issues, ABC Technologies recognizes the need for a modern, sensor-driven inventory management solution that leverages IoT technology and real-time analytics.  

The current demand for digital transformation and the need to enhance operational efficiency make this the ideal time for ABC Technologies to implement an advanced solution. By doing so, the organization aims to optimize its inventory processes, improve accuracy, and gain actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.

### 1.2 Summary  
ABC Technologies is seeking proposals from qualified vendors to design and implement a state-of-the-art **IoT-based Smart Inventory Management System**. The proposed solution should leverage sensor-based technology, real-time tracking, and automated analytics to revolutionize the company's inventory management processes. The goal is to transition from a manual, error-prone system to an intelligent, automated platform that provides real-time visibility, predictive insights, and operational efficiency.  

The key objectives of this initiative include:  
- Automating manual inventory tracking and reducing errors.  
- Enabling real-time monitoring of stock levels and movement.  
- Generating predictive analytics to anticipate stock usage and replenishment needs.  
- Delivering automated alerts for low stock, anomalies, and item expiry.  
- Providing actionable insights through a user-friendly analytics dashboard.  

At a high level, the proposed solution must include IoT sensor integration (e.g., RFID, weight sensors), cloud-based infrastructure (Azure IoT Hub, API backend, and databases), and advanced visualization tools (Power BI). The primary users of the system will include inventory managers, operations teams, and decision-makers within ABC Technologies.  

The expected outcome is a robust, scalable inventory management platform that enhances operational efficiency, minimizes errors, and empowers the organization with data-driven insights. This initiative aligns with ABC Technologies' commitment to leveraging innovative technology to optimize processes and deliver value to stakeholders.
