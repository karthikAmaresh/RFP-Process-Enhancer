## GAP

Based on the provided RFP content, I have identified several gaps between current and proposed solutions:

**Gaps in Current System:**

1. **Manual reference to repair manuals**: The current system relies heavily on manual reference to repair manuals, diagnostic PDFs, OEM knowledge bases, and historical service records, which is slow, inconsistent, and highly dependent on technician expertise.
2. **No centralized search or indexing**: There is no centralized search or indexing of manuals, making it difficult for technicians to find the required information.
3. **No automated troubleshooting workflow**: The current system lacks an automated troubleshooting workflow, requiring technicians to manually search through manuals and documentation.

**Proposed Improvements or New Features:**

1. **Agentic AI-based troubleshooting assistant**: The proposed solution aims to build an Agentic AI-based troubleshooting assistant that can interpret manuals, understand symptoms, and guide technicians toward accurate step-by-step diagnosis.
2. **Document ingestion (PDF, images, manuals)**: The proposed system will ingest documents in various formats (PDF, images, manuals) and extract relevant information.
3. **Text extraction and chunking**: The system will extract text from documents and chunk it into meaningful units for further processing.
4. **Embedding + vector search**: The system will generate embeddings for extracted text and enable vector search to facilitate fast querying of the database.

**Areas Requiring Enhancement:**

1. **Current documentation fragmented across multiple documents**: The current state involves manuals existing across multiple PDF formats, making it difficult to access and utilize the information.
2. **Lack of consistent diagnostic guidance**: Technicians currently lack consistent diagnostic guidance, leading to inconsistent troubleshooting approaches.
3. **Challenges when manuals are fragmented**: When manuals are fragmented across multiple documents, technicians face challenges in finding the required information.

**Functionality Gaps:**

1. **No automated root cause identification**: The current system lacks an automated root cause identification mechanism, which is essential for efficient troubleshooting.
2. **No recommendation explanation**: The proposed solution aims to provide guided troubleshooting steps and recommendation explanations to technicians.

**Features Requested but Not Currently Available:**

1. **Multi-agent system for symptom understanding, troubleshooting step generation, and root cause identification**: The proposed system will incorporate a multi-agent system for these features, which are currently not available.
2. **Ul design (technician dashboard + chat + recommendations)**: The proposed solution includes an Ul design with a technician dashboard, chat functionality, and recommendation features.

**Differences between Current State and Desired Future State:**

1. **From manual reference to automated troubleshooting**: The desired future state involves automating the troubleshooting process, whereas the current system relies on manual reference.
2. **From fragmented documentation to centralized access**: The proposed solution aims to centralize access to documentation, whereas the current state involves fragmented manuals.

In summary, the RFP highlights several gaps in the current system, including:

* Manual reference to repair manuals
* No centralized search or indexing
* No automated troubleshooting workflow

The proposed solution aims to address these gaps by incorporating Agentic AI-based features, such as document ingestion, text extraction, embedding, and vector search. The desired future state involves automating the troubleshooting process, providing consistent diagnostic guidance, and facilitating fast querying of the database.

Please note that this gap analysis is based on my understanding of the RFP content and may not cover all aspects of the proposed solution or potential gaps.
